What Are Algorithms:
- An algorithm is a clearly defined sequence of instructions used to solve problems or perform tasks. Algorithms are the foundation of all programming and computing operations
- Time Complexity: Refers to how long an algorithm takes to execute as the input size changes. Examples of common complexities are:
- O(1): Constant execution time
- O(n): Linear time
- O(n²): Quadratic time
- Space Complexity: This measures how much memory the algorithm requires as the input size increases
- An algorithm is a step-by-step method for solving problems or completing tasks. They are at the heart of software development and computational problem-solving
- O(n²): Execution time grows quadratically
- Sorting algorithms reorder data in a specified way, typically in ascending or descending order. Common sorting algorithms include:
- Bubble Sort: This algorithm compares and swaps adjacent elements repeatedly until the entire list is sorted. Time complexity: O(n²)
- Merge Sort: It uses a divide-and-conquer approach to split data into smaller arrays, sort them, and then merge them back together. Time complexity: O(n log n)
Searching Methods:
- Searching algorithms help find specific elements in a data structure. Two common methods include:
- Binary Search: Efficiently finds elements in a sorted array by halving the search space at each step. Time complexity: O(log n)
Types of Data Structures:
- Data structures refer to various ways of organizing and storing data, allowing efficient access and modification of the data
- Arrays: Ordered collections of elements stored in contiguous memory. Arrays offer constant-time element access but require resizing to accommodate larger data
- Linked Lists: A sequence of nodes, where each node holds data and a reference to the next node. They allow dynamic resizing and efficient insertions or deletions
- Data structures are frameworks used to store and manage data, optimizing access and modifications
Common Sorting Techniques:
- Sorting algorithms are methods to rearrange data in a specific order, such as ascending or descending. Two popular sorting algorithms are:
- Bubble Sort: Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. Time complexity: O(n²)
- Merge Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into halves, recursively sorts them, and merges them back together. Time complexity: O(n log n)
Efficient Search Techniques:
- Search algorithms are used to locate elements in data structures. Two widely used search algorithms are:
- Linear Search: Sequentially examines each element in a list until the target value is found. Time complexity: O(n)
